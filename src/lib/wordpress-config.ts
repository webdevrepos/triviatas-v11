/**
 * WordPress Connection Config
 *
 * Managed by PhantomWP. Rewritten when you change your WordPress URL or
 * image-source mode in the IDE. Safe to commit -- and safe to publish, even
 * to a public GitHub repo, because the access secret is NEVER stored here.
 *
 * Your secret lives in .env (gitignored) for local development and in your
 * hosting platform's env-var settings for production. Astro reads it via
 * import.meta.env.WP_ACCESS_SECRET at build time.
 *
 * If you want to add custom helpers, put them in src/lib/functions.ts (which
 * PhantomWP never overwrites). The full WordPress client lives in
 * @phantomwp/wordpress (.phantomwp/runtime/lib/wordpress.ts).
